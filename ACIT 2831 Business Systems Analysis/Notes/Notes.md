## Terms to Know  
### Day 1
`Data : refus to raw facts that are collected or recorded 

`Information : data that has been processed or orginized 

`Information System : Collection of people, processes, and technology that work together to manage and process data to produce usefull information. 
		`Example : System used to track inventory. 

`Waterfall :  methodology/approach to a project of any kind that represents that each step is its own part of the process, can't go to the next step without doing the one before

`LMS : (learning management software/system) used to plan, deliver, and manage educational courses or training programs 
		`ex: Moodle, D2L

`Agile : method of software that emphasizes flexability and iteration program adaptation, through small, incremental improvments

`Scrum : framework for managing and completing complex projects, based on the agile approach`

`System/software development lifecycle : (SDLC) high quality, low cost structured process 5 or 7 step process: 
			`1. Preminilary Design 
			`2. System Analysis
			`3. System Design
			`4. Programming 
			`5. Testing 
			`6. Implementation `[^1 ]
			`7. Maintenance`[^2]
[^1] Pre-Production
[^2] Production

`Business System Analysis : the analysis of business systems`

### Day 2

`Revenue : income generated by business operation - $ from selling products/services`

`Profit :  financial benefit realized when revenue generated from a business operation exceeds the expenses, costs, and taxes involved 
		`> Also known as the bottom Line`

`Asset : resourse that is meant to be used for at least over a year to generate profit
		`ex: land, caplital, a computer`

`Investment : Acquisition of an asset with hope it will generate a return/appreciation - involves risk`

`TCO : (total cost of ownership) acquisition costs and operating costs, including EOL 
		`ex: information system`

`ROI : (return on investment) value of investments and comparing them %%

# Day 2

- ### Implementing 
	- Trade offs 
		- Whats the cost?
		- Can it even be done?
		- etc
- ### SDLC (System/software Development Lifecycle)
	- **Preliminary Analysis** 
		- A request for a replacement or new system is first reviewed
		- `What is the problem-to-be-solved? Creating a solution possible? Alternatives? ...`
		- Important in determining if the project should be initiated 
			- the purpsoe 
			- assessment basics 
			- CBA (cost benefit analysis)

---
- ### Exercise 
	- [B.C. shells out $300K to help fund 3rd study into high-speed rail to Washington and Oregon](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-funds-3rd-high-speed-rail-study-to-u-s-1.6582003)
	- What are they doing?
		- BC government is investing another $300,000 (on top of $600,000) into a high speed rail system between Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland. 
	- What's the problem?
		- cost
	- What's the (estimated) cost?
		- "Cost of construction estimated at $42 billion US"
	- Who would pay those costs?
	- What are the benefits?
		- Much faster transportation - 400km max
			- greener 
			- lower cost
			- more jobs
			- comfort
	- Who receives the benefits?
		- People
	- What are the alternatives?
	-

# Day 3

- ### Netflix 
	- what does it offer?
	- watch movies
	- downloads
	 - games
	 - multi languages
	 - diff devices 
	 - keeps track 
	 - recommendation
	 - catalog
	 - multi-profile
	 - Performance 
	 - security
	 - 
- ## Requirements 
	- what a business needs from its information systems AND how it needs those systems to operate
	- The business needs **ALL** of its requirements
		- Software/Systems
		- needs information systems
	- **Functional** => specific features or functionallity that software must have in order to meet the needs of its users 
		- what we usually see
	- **Non-Functional** => broader characteristics of the software. such as performance, security, and usability
		- not something we usually think about
		- != not important 
- ## SDLC 
	- **CBA** drives the entire process ROI
		- Job Security 
	- How are they connected to requirements
		1. Preminilary Design
			- uses the problem to create requirements
			- what problem to solve?
		2. System Analysis
			- Requirements elicititation 
		3. System Design
			- Design UI/UX based on the requirements
		4. Programming 
			- Develop requirements from design
		5. Testing 
			- Functional requirement - Ensures functionality of a software 
			- testing functional requirements
		6. Implementation
			- production 
			- UAT
			- installing the system (HW, SW, people, ) 
			- Peformance (non-functional) meets requirements (testing non-functional requirements)
		7. Maintenance 
			- bug fixes 
			- new features + new requirements 
- ## Accessibility 
	- Specific connotations in our field
	- **Not** a fancy way to say "easy to use" or "nice-looking"
---
- Exercise
	- functional requirements
		- What does the application need to do?
		- what are the necessary features or capabilities 
	- non-functional requirements 
		- constraints on how the application should function 
		- ex: compliance, performance, support
---
- ## FURPS + requirements
	- Functionality 
		- Capabilities and features of the app (product)
	- Usability 
		- Considering the person (or people) who will be using the app
	- Reliability 
		- How much system downtime is acceptable
	- Performance
		- Application response time throughput
		- (Accuracy)
	- Supportability
		- Make sure the application can be tested, extended, serviced. installed and configured
- ## Scalability
	- Accomidate increase/decrease business volume in info systems

# Day 4
- Review 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230127084345.png]]
