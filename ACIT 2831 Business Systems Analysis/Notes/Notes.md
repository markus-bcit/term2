### Day 2

`Revenue : income generated by business operation - $ from selling products/services`

`Profit :  financial benefit realized when revenue generated from a business operation exceeds the expenses, costs, and taxes involved 
		`> Also known as the bottom Line`

`Asset : resourse that is meant to be used for at least over a year to generate profit

	- what a business needs from its information systems AND how it needs those systems to operate
	- The business needs **ALL** of its requirements
		- Software/Systems
		- needs information systems
	- **Functional** => specific features or functionallity that software must have in order to meet the needs of its users 
		- what we usually see
	- **Non-Functional** => broader characteristics of the software. such as performance, security, and usability
		- not something we usually think about
		- != not important 
- ## SDLC 
	- **CBA** drives the entire process ROI
		- Job Security 
	- How are they connected to requirements
		1. Preminilary Design
			- uses the problem to create requirements
			- what problem to solve?
		2. System Analysis
			- Requirements elicititation 
		3. System Design
			- Design UI/UX based on the requirements
		4. Programming 
			- Develop requirements from design
		5. Testing 
			- Functional requirement - Ensures functionality of a software 
			- testing functional requirements
		6. Implementation
			- production 
			- UAT
			- installing the system (HW, SW, people, ) 
			- Peformance (non-functional) meets requirements (testing non-functional requirements)
		7. Maintenance 
			- bug fixes 
			- new features + new requirements 
- ## Accessibility 
	- Specific connotations in our field
	- **Not** a fancy way to say "easy to use" or "nice-looking"
---
- Exercise
	- functional requirements
		- What does the application need to do?
		- what are the necessary features or capabilities

# Day 6
## Review 
`Production: any information system an orginization uses in its day-to-day operations`

# Day 8
## Cloud Services 
- #### On Prem:
	- a cloud-like environment that is deployed on-premises, meaning within an organization's own data center, rather than being hosted by a third-party provider.
- #### Public Cloud 
	- 3rd-party
	- cloud computing model in which a third-party provider offers computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, over the internet. These resources are shared among multiple users, typically through a pay-per-use or subscription-based pricing model.
- #### Hybrid Cloud 
	- computing environment that combines elements of both public and private cloud models. In a hybrid cloud, some computing resources are hosted in a public cloud, while others are hosted in a private cloud or on-premises data center.
- BUILDING BLOCKS FOR A WEB/SERVER/CLOUD
- #### SaaS (Software as a Service)
	- the provider hosts and maintains the software application and infrastructure, while customers access and use the software through a subscription-based pricing model .This allows customers to use the software without having to invest in expensive hardware, install and maintain software locally, or manage updates and security patches.
		- office 365, adobe, gmail, lms
- #### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
	- It is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider offers a complete platform that allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure
		- azue , aws
- #### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
	- cloud computing model where a third-party provider hosts and maintains infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking components, that is then made available to customers over the internet
- #### Configure
	- involves adjusting settings, options, or parameters to optimize the performance, security, and functionality of a system or application to make sure that the system is secure and optimized
- #### Customize
	- feature extension that requires coding
	- process of modifying or adapting a product or service to meet specific user or customer needs. Customization involves adjusting the settings, interface, features, or functionalities of software, hardware, or websites to suit individual preferences or requirements
- #### In-House
	- practice of keeping a particular function, activity, or service within an organization or company rather than outsourcing it to a third party or external provider.
- #### Differentiation (strategy)
	- competitive strategy that seeks to distinguish a company's products or services from those of its competitors by offering unique and superior features, quality, performance, design, or customer service. The goal of differentiation is to create a perceived value among customers that exceeds the cost of producing the product or service, leading to increased customer loyalty, premium pricing, and market share.
## System Aquisition Strategies
- #### Make
	- requirements need to make - can't/won't get from a third party
	- harder/more expensive
- #### Buy
	- standard functionallity ex: office 365, salesforce
	- lower cost
- #### Rent
	- Cloud, subscriptions 
	- can be expensive and harder to customize, but potentially lower TCO
	- scalablity
	- **Important** - **no** custody of data
	-

# Day 9
- #### Review
	- Problem intitiates SQLC 
	- requirements are made in the second step 
	- requirements are somthing a business needs
		- what we need an information 
		- functional => does what we need it to do
		- non-functional => parameters in uses to do what it needs to do
	- scalability 
	- business process => recipe we follow to achieve a goal 
```bash
while getopts ":d:t:" opt; do
  case $opt in
    d)
      due_by_date="$OPTARG"
      ;;
    t)
      tag="$OPTARG"
      ;;
    \?)
      echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2
      show_help
      exit 1
      ;;
    :)
      echo "Option -$OPTARG requires an argument." >&2
      show_help
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))
```
